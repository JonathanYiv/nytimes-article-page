# NYTimes Article Page Project

This purpose of this project was to practice positioning and floating in HTML/CSS by implementing this [NY Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements).
